# Port Scanner for Ranges of IP Addresses
This code tests four different IP ranges. Each range is specified as a tuple with the first element as the IP prefix and the second element as the size of the range. The code iterates through each IP in the range and checks if the specified port (XPORT) is open or closed.

ðŸ”´ REPLACE "XPORT" WITH THE PORT NUBMER YOU WANT TO SCAN
